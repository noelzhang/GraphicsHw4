This scene is rendered with blurry reflections and considered the depth of the field.
We also used a quad area light. 
The idea of imitating the two effect is quit similar. 
We generate several rays with some small scale of deflection.
Then the scene will looks more "real"..
It really cost some time(2k+ seconds).
